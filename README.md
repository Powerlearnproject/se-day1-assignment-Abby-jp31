#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is designing,developing and maintenance of software systems.
Its efficient ,reliable and scalable

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):  Structured programming emerged as a response to the challenges of managing complex code and improving software reliability. It introduced the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, manageable modules, each with a single entry and exit point. 
Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s): Object-oriented programming revolutionized software development by organizing code around objects rather than functions or procedures. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for better modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. 
Introduction of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s): Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid software development processes like the Waterfall model. Agile promotes iterative and incremental development, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
